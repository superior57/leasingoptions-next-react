Plus, leasing cars with lower CO2 emissions will reduce the amount of company car tax you owe.\"\n  }, {\n    question: \"Is it worth leasing a car through my business?\",\n    answer: \"Business car leasing gives you and your employees the benefit of driving a new car or van every 2-4 years.

Personal car leasing doesn’t offer the same tax benefits, which is why it’s cheaper to choose business car leasing.\"\n  }, {\n    question: \"What’s the difference between personal and business car leasing?\",\n    answer: \"Personal and business car leasing are similar.
