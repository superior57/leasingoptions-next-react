Whether you are self-employed and need one van or you own a company and require a full fleet, business van leasing is an affordable option, with fixed payments and no large initial outlay.\"\n  }, {\n    question: \"Is leasing a van tax deductible?\",\n    answer: \"VAT-registered businesses can reclaim 50% of the VAT on their monthly lease payments, or 100% if the van is just used for work or as a pool van. You can also claim a van lease and fuel as business expenses on your tax return.\"\n  }, {\n    question: \"Should I lease or buy a van for business?\",\n    answer: \"With leasing, you can drive a new van every 2-4 years while making low monthly payments.
