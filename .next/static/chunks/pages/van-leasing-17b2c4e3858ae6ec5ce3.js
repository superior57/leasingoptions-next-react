You pay an initial rental fee then make fixed monthly payments until your contract ends. Then, you return the van(s) to the leasing company. Read more in our <a href="https://www.leasingoptions.co.uk/advice/van-leasing/the-complete-guide-to-van-leasing">van leasing guide</a>.'},{question:"Is van leasing a good idea?",answer:"Popular benefits of van leasing include driving the latest van(s) every 2-4 years, low monthly payments, a manufacturer\u2019s warranty, fewer maintenance costs, tax advantages and no expensive upfront costs."},{question:"Can I lease a van for business?",answer:"All our van leases are intended for business customers.
